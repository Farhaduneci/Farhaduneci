Web developer, web design eager, I've been endeavoring both to study and grasp knowledge about many programming languages including C++, Java, JavaScript, XML, PHP, and HTML/CSS. I've also worked with some frameworks like Laravel. Love to work with a large community of developers to maintain and improve projects in Git and Git-lab.
